  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <h4>User Settings</h4>
  <p>The user should be able to set some settings, that will effect the end result of the color scheme. Primarily this includes a <em>Primary</em> and <em>Secondary</em> color. Using these colors should change the main and secondary colors of the theme. The user selected colors should be selected from one of the default color set colors.</p>
  <p>There should always be two variants of the color scheme. One with a dark background, and one with a light background.</p>
  <h4>Default Colors</h4>
  <p>The background color should be either <b>Grey 1</b> for light variants or <b>Grey 10</b> for dark variants. Then the foreground should be the other color of those two. So if the background is <b>Grey 10</b>, then the foreground should be <b>Grey 1</b>.</p>
  <p>The accent colors should be an assortment chosen from the default colors. Commonly go with <b>Red</b>, <b>Purple</b>, <b>Blue</b>, <b>Cyan</b>, <b>Green</b>, and <b>Amber</b> when the number of colors is limited. Such as for a terminal color scheme.</p>
